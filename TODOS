##TODOs

We will be writing some goals for both the classroom as well as further implementations here (in the absence of a formal issue tracker). Every version of this file will be branch-specific.

####Points for students

- Ask the students why the pointer check in the custom stack traversal is required.
- Point out to the students what an advanced IDE can do for them (IntelliJ realizes that invariant cannot be violated and reports as such in custom stack traversal).

#### Code 

- Need to implement a timing client for different inorder traversals.

- Recursive list traversal vs custom stack - based traversal: compare through a timing and heap-checking client.
